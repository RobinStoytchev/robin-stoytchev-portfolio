## Robin Stoytchev's Portfolio

Welcome! 

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a fun, clean, and responsive showcase of my web development skills and projects. Check out the live site here: https://robinstoytchev.netlify.app/

- **Purpose**:
This portfolio is designed to showcase my personal work, share useful content, and connect with collaborators or potential employers. The website features sections for my bio, projects, and contact information. It’s a static website with no backend, making it lightweight and easy to maintain.

- **Tech Stack**:
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript (ES6+)
  - Node.js (for Netlify Functions)
  - Axios (for API requests in Netlify Functions)
  - Netlify (for hosting and serverless functions)

Hosted On: Netlify

Features responsive design that works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Smooth animations and transitions for an engaging user experience.
Clean, minimalistic layout with a focus on readability and aesthetics.
Easy-to-navigate sections for my bio, skills, projects, and contact details.

## Translation Feature
This portfolio supports multiple languages using a serverless Netlify Function that integrates with the DeepL API. Users can request translations via the website, which triggers a function to translate content in real-time. The function uses Axios to communicate with DeepL and is hosted on Netlify alongside the static site.
